this is central to the vmaxvolumetoexportmaskruleapplicator class . we are essentially trying to have a wrapper around this method because it needs to be called in different contexts . one context is when this is a native vmax export operation . this context requires workflow steps , so this what the postapply ( ) is for . the second context is when we are suggesting exportmasks to use for a set of initiators for the vplex backend . the vplex backend workflow bypasses these maskingorchestrator implementation and creates steps that reference the exportmaskoperations . so , there ' s no need to have extra workflow steps done after applyrules . we are trying to get only the rules to run so that we have a set of exportmasks that we can suggest for the vplex backend workflow .

there are two reasons why we don ' t use buffer per window when vista ' s dwm ( aka aero ) is enabled : - since with dwm all windows are already double - buffered , the application doesn ' t get expose events so we don ' t get to use our true back - buffer , wasting memory and performance ( this is valid for both d3d and gdi pipelines ) - in some cases with buffer per window enabled it is possible for the paint manager to redirect rendering to the screen for some operations ( like copyarea ) , and since bpw uses its own bufferstrategy the d3d onscreen rendering support is disabled and rendering goes through gdi . this doesn ' t work well with vista ' s dwm since one can not perform gdi and d3d operations on the same surface ( see 6630702 for more info ) note : even though dwm composition state can change during the lifetime of the application it is a rare event , and it is more often that it is temporarily disabled ( because of some app ) than it is getting permanently enabled so we can live with this approach without the complexity of dwm state listeners and such . this can be revisited if proved otherwise .
