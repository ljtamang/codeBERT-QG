layout static graphic modifiers around the symbol . static modifiers are not expected to change due to changes in view . the static layout is computed when a modifier is changed , but may not be computed each frame . for example , a text modifier indicating a symbol identifier would only need to be laid out when the text is changed , so this is best treated as a static modifier . however a direction of movement line that needs to be computed based on the current eye position should be treated as a dynamic modifier .

this method iteratively estimates the parameters of the bayes net using the dataset until the parameters don ' t change . that is , the newly estimated parameters are used in the estimate method to produce even more accurate parameters ( with respect to the dataset ) etc . the threshhold is compared to the distance between successive parameter sets and when the change is less than the threshhold , the process is considered to have converged . the distance between successive bayes nets is the euclidean distance between vectors of sequences of their parameters . see the bayesimdistancefunction class for details .

this method determines which menu items get to be ' action items ' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be ' overflow items ' in a secondary menu . the rules are as follows : < p > items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu . there is a limit of mmaxactionitems as a total count , optionally including the overflow menu button itself . this is a soft limit ; if an item shares a group id with an item previously included as an action item , the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit . this is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar . only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space , and groups are treated as a single concept . < p > there is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space : mactionwidthlimit . this limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space , but no further items may be added . if an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width , the entire group will be demoted to overflow . this is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general ui clutter . < p > the space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items . once items begin to overflow , all future items become overflow items as well . this is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app ' s intended design .

gets the overlap between this interval and another interval . < p > intervals are inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end . an interval overlaps another if it shares some common part of the datetime continuum . this method returns the amount of the overlap , only if the intervals actually do overlap . if the intervals do not overlap , then null is returned . < p > when two intervals are compared the result is one of three states : ( a ) they abut , ( b ) there is a gap between them , ( c ) they overlap . the abuts state takes precedence over the other two , thus a zero duration interval at the start of a larger interval abuts and does not overlap . < p > the chronology of the returned interval is the same as that of this interval ( the chronology of the interval parameter is not used ) . note that the use of the chronology was only correctly implemented in version 1 . 3 .
