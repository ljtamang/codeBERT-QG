a variant test in there is a blank node in the bindings to be flowed through to the remote service . in this test the blank nodes are correlated but there is only one solution to be vectored so we will impose a filter on the remote service to enforce that correlation . this test differs from the previous test by making more than two variables in the service clause correlated through shared blank nodes . we need to use a more complex service graph pattern to accomplish this since the predicate can not be a blank node .

grow the pixel buffer if necessary . using this method instead of allocating a new buffer every time a frame is grabbed improves performance by reducing the frequency of garbage collections . in a simple test , the unmodified version of ipcameraframegrabber caused about 200mb of allocations within 13 seconds . in this version , almost no additional heap space is typically allocated per frame . the downside to this is that the returned frames can ' t really be modified , so this probably won ' t go upstream , but it ' s useful for us because in grip we don ' t operate on images in - place .

summary . for any syntax error thrown by the parser , there will be an errornode in the parse tree and this method will process it . all errors correspond to actual tokens in the input except for missing token errors . there are there are multiple error situations to consider : 1 . extraneous token . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 2 . token mismatch . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 3 . missing token . the parse tree will have an errornode but it does not correspond to any bit of the input . we underline the current token . 4 . noviablealt ( input inconsistent with any rule alt ) . the parse tree will have an errornode for token . 5 . tokens consumed to resync the parser during recovery . the parse tree will have an errornode for each token . this is complicated by errors that occur at eof but i have modified error strategy to add error nodes for eof if needed . another complication . during prediction , we might match n tokens and then fail on the n + 1 token , leading to noviablealtexception . but , it ' s offending token is at n + 1 not current token where prediction started ( which we use to find syntax errors ) . so , syntaxerror objects return start not offending token in this case .

encodes the given byte array into a string that can be used by the sqlite database . the database cannot handle null ( 0x00 ) and the character ' \ ' ' ( 0x27 ) . the encoding consists of escaping these characters with a reserved character ( 0x01 ) . the escaping is applied after determining and applying a shift that minimizes the number of escapes required . with this encoding the data of original size n is increased to a maximum of 1 + ( n * 257 ) / 254 . for sufficiently large n the overhead is thus less than 1 . 2 % .

this method may be invoked by life cycle operations which need to tear down the bigdata environment . normally you do not need to do this as the cleaner service uses a daemon thread and will not prevent the jvm from halting . however , a servlet container running bigdata can complain that some threads were not terminated if the webapp running bigdata is stopped . you can invoke this method to terminate the stale reference cleaner thread .
